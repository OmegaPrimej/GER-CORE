AI Studio API Key
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

AI Studio API Endpoint
endpoint = "https://api.ai.meta.com/studio/v1"

Define the code refinement parameters
code_refinement_params = {
    "language": "Python",
    "framework": "TensorFlow",
    "optimization_level": "high"
}

Send a request to AI Studio to refine code
response = requests.post(
    f"{endpoint}/refine-code",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
    json=code_refinement_params
)

Check if the response was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Get the refined code
    refined_code = response.json()["refined_code"]

    # Print the refined code
    print("Refined Code:")
    print(refined_code)
else:
    print("Failed to refine code:", response.text)
```

Please note that you'll need to replace *YOUR_API_KEY_HERE* with your actual AI Studio API key, My Queen.
